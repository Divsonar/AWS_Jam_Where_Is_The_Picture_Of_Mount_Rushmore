Repo for AWS Jam Challenge - Where is the picture of Mount Rushmore? Solution  
Category : Machine Learning  

Business Problem  
Welcome to this challenge! You have been recently hired by Anycorp (a major news broadcaster) as a data scientist. Your boss (non-technical) tells you that the company has built a large image archive over the years. Unfortunately, there is no/very little metadata associated with the images which makes it difficult for Anycorp journalists and news anchors to find relevant ones. Your boss points out that most of the images contain text which is important for understanding the context of the image. For your first project, your boss asks you to build a smart cloud solution to automatically extract metadata from the images.  

Learning Objectives  
In this challenge, you are going to extract various type of information from the images to make it easier for the Anycorp journalists to find relevant images. To acomplish this goal, you are going to leverage AWS image (Amazon Rekogntion) and NLP (Amazon Comprehend) AI services which make advanced machine learning accessible without the need to train any model!  

Task 1 : Copy CSV File from s3 bucket to notebook using AWS S3   
Task 2 : Determine language that each review is written in using AWS Comprehend  
Task 3 : Determine sentiment of each review using AWS Comprehend  
Task 4 : Filter only the negative columns and get their review_id, save it to a csv file and copy it back to the s3 bucket using AWS S3
